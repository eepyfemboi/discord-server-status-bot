# discord-server-status-bot
a discord.py bot that checks whether your server members have your vanity link in their custom status and gives them a role based on that

i dont feel like helping anyone who doesn't know what they're doing, since the code is easy enough to understand.

if you can't figure out how to use this, then go learn python first, don't open an issue
